# Advent of Code
My solutions for Advent of Code, written in Rust

# Test puzzles
I use [cargo-aoc](https://lib.rs/crates/cargo-aoc) for automatically downloading input and handling other things like tests, benchmarks and generator functions. You can install it with `cargo install cargo-aoc`.

Most years require nightly Rust because I used some unstable features.

To run a specific day, use:
```bash
cd <year>
cargo aoc credentials -s <token>
cargo aoc -d <day>
```
